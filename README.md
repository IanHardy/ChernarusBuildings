Chernarus Enhancements
======================

Custom areas created for use in DayZ Epoch Chernarus

These areas have all been completely done from scratch and everything is my own work.
I have taken special care when adding buildings so to not ruin the feeling of any of the areas. You won't find random barracks placed inside Cherno or anything ridiculous like that! I maintained a vision of adding to the existing template of the areas I have done custom additions to. I carefully placed buildings, roads etc in and around existing patches on the ground for extra visual fidelity and basically so these areas would look as if they could have been in the final map release.

Some of the areas have some elements of DayZ Standalone as I wanted to recreate some of the areas for the Epoch mod.

I'd like to thank all the contributors at opendayz.net and the forums over at epochmod.com for a fantastic community.
I have learned so much from all the people there.

Special thanks to Barbara Parkes, my fiancee for being so patient while I was creating these areas.
